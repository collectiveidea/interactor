module Interactor
  # Public: The object for tracking state of an Interactor's invocation. The
  # context is used to initialize the interactor with the information required
  # for invocation. The interactor manipulates the context to produce the result
  # of invocation.
  #
  # The context is the mechanism by which success and failure are determined and
  # the context is responsible for tracking individual interactor invocations
  # for the purpose of rollback.
  #
  # The context may be manipulated using arbitrary getter and setter methods.
  #
  # Examples
  #
  #   context = Interactor::Context.new
  #   # => #<Interactor::Context>
  #   context.foo = "bar"
  #   # => "bar"
  #   context
  #   # => #<Interactor::Context foo="bar">
  #   context.hello = "world"
  #   # => "world"
  #   context
  #   # => #<Interactor::Context foo="bar" hello="world">
  #   context.foo = "baz"
  #   # => "baz"
  #   context
  #   # => #<Interactor::Context foo="baz" hello="world">
